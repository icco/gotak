A Tak server

## Summary

The rough goal of this repo is to create a server that lets two people play tak together no matter their client. It needs to do the following things:

 - Parse PTN format
 - Provide a shared set of state between two players for a game
 - Store game history
 - Provide some sort of scoring?
